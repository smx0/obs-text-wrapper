# Text Wrapper

This plugin allows users to quickly wrap selected text in the editor with customizable HTML tags. Up to three tags can be configured in Settings and bound to hotkeys. You can also input a new tag using a modal accessed from the command palette. If no text is selected, the tags will be set adjacent to each other. This plugin is especially useful for those who frequently use lesser known HTML tags like`<dd>`,`<dt>`, and `<dl>`. 

This plugin is open source.
